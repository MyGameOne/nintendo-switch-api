# Multi-Platform Gaming API Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the current Nintendo Switch API into a comprehensive multi-platform gaming API that supports multiple gaming platforms (Nintendo Switch, Xbox Live, and future platforms like PlayStation, Steam). The primary goal is to create a unified, scalable architecture that can handle different gaming platforms while maintaining clean separation of concerns and consistent API interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Architecture Restructuring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized multi-platform project structure, so that I can easily maintain and extend support for different gaming platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the codebase SHALL be organized into platform-specific modules under a `platforms/` directory
2. WHEN a new platform is added THEN it SHALL follow the established directory structure pattern without affecting existing platforms
3. WHEN shared functionality is needed THEN it SHALL be placed in a `shared/` directory accessible to all platforms
4. WHEN the project is built THEN all existing Nintendo Switch API functionality SHALL remain intact and functional
5. WHEN the project structure is updated THEN the build process SHALL work without modification to deployment configuration

### Requirement 2: Unified API Route Structure

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent and predictable API endpoints across different gaming platforms, so that I can easily integrate multiple platforms into my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing platform-specific endpoints THEN they SHALL follow the pattern `/api/{platform}/{resource}`
2. WHEN the Nintendo Switch API is accessed THEN existing endpoints SHALL be available under `/api/nintendo/*` paths
3. WHEN Xbox API endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the same pattern under `/api/xbox/*` paths
4. WHEN cross-platform statistics are requested THEN they SHALL be available under `/api/stats` endpoint
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL cover all active platforms under `/health` endpoint
6. WHEN backward compatibility is required THEN legacy Nintendo endpoints SHALL redirect to new paths with deprecation warnings

### Requirement 3: Shared Type System and Utilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified type system and shared utilities, so that I can maintain consistency across platforms and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common data structures are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in shared type definitions
2. WHEN platform-specific types are required THEN they SHALL extend or implement shared base interfaces
3. WHEN utility functions are needed across platforms THEN they SHALL be placed in shared utility modules
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use a consistent error response format across all platforms
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow a unified response schema with platform-specific data sections

### Requirement 4: Platform Abstraction Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear abstraction layer for different gaming platforms, so that I can implement platform-specific logic without affecting the core application structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a platform service is implemented THEN it SHALL implement a common platform interface
2. WHEN authentication is handled THEN each platform SHALL have its own authentication service following a common pattern
3. WHEN user data is retrieved THEN each platform SHALL provide user information in a standardized format
4. WHEN game records are fetched THEN each platform SHALL return game data following a common schema
5. WHEN platform-specific features are accessed THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and optional in the common interface

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration management for multiple platforms, so that I can enable/disable platforms and configure platform-specific settings independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load platform configurations from environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN a platform is disabled THEN its endpoints SHALL return appropriate "platform not available" responses
3. WHEN platform-specific secrets are needed THEN they SHALL be managed separately and securely
4. WHEN development and production environments differ THEN platform configurations SHALL be environment-specific
5. WHEN new platforms are added THEN they SHALL be configurable without code changes to existing platforms

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing API consumer, I want my current Nintendo Switch API integrations to continue working, so that I don't need to immediately update my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing Nintendo API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL continue to work with the same response format
2. WHEN legacy endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL include deprecation headers with migration information
3. WHEN the migration period ends THEN legacy endpoints SHALL redirect to new endpoints with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include migration guides for existing consumers
5. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be versioned and communicated with sufficient advance notice

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage for the multi-platform architecture, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions when adding new platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platform services are implemented THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering all public methods
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL have integration tests verifying request/response behavior
3. WHEN shared utilities are developed THEN they SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
4. WHEN the application is built THEN all tests SHALL pass in the CI/CD pipeline
5. WHEN new platforms are added THEN they SHALL include test suites following established patterns

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer working with the API, I want clear documentation and examples for each platform, so that I can quickly understand how to integrate with different gaming platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is documented THEN it SHALL include platform-specific endpoint documentation
2. WHEN authentication flows are described THEN they SHALL include step-by-step guides for each platform
3. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate common use cases for each platform
4. WHEN the project structure is documented THEN it SHALL include guidelines for adding new platforms
5. WHEN API changes are made THEN the documentation SHALL be updated simultaneously

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the multi-platform API to maintain high performance and scalability, so that it can handle increased load from multiple gaming platforms efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple platforms are active THEN the API response time SHALL not exceed 2 seconds for any endpoint
2. WHEN platform-specific caching is implemented THEN it SHALL be isolated and not affect other platforms
3. WHEN error rates are monitored THEN they SHALL be tracked per platform for better debugging
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN platform failures SHALL not cascade to affect other platforms
5. WHEN resource usage is measured THEN it SHALL be optimized for Cloudflare Workers environment constraints

### Requirement 10: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user of gaming platforms, I want my authentication data and personal information to be handled securely across all supported platforms, so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted and have appropriate expiration times
2. WHEN platform-specific credentials are managed THEN they SHALL be isolated and not shared between platforms
3. WHEN user data is processed THEN it SHALL comply with platform-specific privacy requirements
4. WHEN API keys and secrets are used THEN they SHALL be stored securely and rotated regularly
5. WHEN cross-platform data is aggregated THEN user consent SHALL be obtained and privacy preferences respected
